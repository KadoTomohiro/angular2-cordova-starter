### development
You can use angular-cli for angular2 development.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To run the complete cordova application, you first have to build your angular2 app using `ng build`. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
Then you're able to prepare your app for the target system using `cordova run <platform>` where platform could be `browser`.
A shortcut for deploying the app is available as NPM script.
Just run `npm run browser`.

### Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

### Running unit tests

### Running end-to-end tests
